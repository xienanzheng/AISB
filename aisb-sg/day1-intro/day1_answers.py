# W1D1 - LLM Internals: What Goes In, What Comes Out

On the first day, we'll warm up by looking under the hood of LLM inference APIs — the primary interface through which models are exposed to applications, and the substrate on which all attacks and defenses build. We'll explore how conversations are serialized into tokens, what the model actually computes (logprobs), and where the boundaries between "instructions" and "data" break down.

This is also a chance to get your environment set up and iron out any technical issues. If you run into problems, don't hesitate to ask the teaching assistants!

## 1️⃣ LLM Internals: What Goes In, What Comes Out

Model inference APIs are the primary way how LLMs are exposed to the world and consumed by applications. They define the primary attack surface both for the model and indirectly for all applications built on top — so understanding them is critical to both attack and defense.

While LLM APIs typically expose structured chat interfaces, a look one level deeper reveals that the model itself only sees a **sequence of tokens** derived from a serialized conversation - what looks a well-designed protocol can in fact behave like an _unstructured channel_!

### Exercise 1.1: Conversation Serialization

> **Difficulty**: 🔴🔴⚪⚪⚪
> **Importance**: 🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪

Let's start by looking at the standard OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions API. It accepts structured messages (system, user, assistant, tool) which are converted into a single token sequence under the hood. Different model families use different **chat templates** to serialize messages.

<!-- FIXME: are different templates demonstrated? reference https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter11/2#common-template-formats -->

Below is a multi-turn conversation that includes all message roles. Your task: construct the serialized string that a model would see, following the ChatML format (used by many OpenAI-compatible models).

<summary>Answer</summary>

The injected `<|im_start|>` IS a control token (◆)! `apply_chat_template` renders the Jinja template to a flat string first, then tokenizes — so it can't distinguish template-inserted vs content-inserted special tokens. This is a real token-level injection.

<strong>How do real API providers protect against this?</strong>

Real API serving stacks (vLLM, TGI, proprietary backends like OpenAI's) tokenize each message part **separately** and insert control tokens programmatically as raw token IDs. User content never passes through a code path where `<|im_start|>` could be recognized as a special token — it's just encoded as regular text. So in production, this injection doesn't work at the token level (though prompt injection at the *semantic* level is a different story — we'll get to that later).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Vocabulary: Base vs. Instruct Models</summary>

A **base model** (e.g. SmolLM2-135M) is trained on raw text to predict the next token. An **instruct model** (e.g. SmolLM2-135M-Instruct) is further fine-tuned to follow a specific conversational structure — including tool use, multi-turn dialogue, and function calling.

Chat templates like ChatML are what bridge the gap: they define *how* the structured conversation is serialized into a token sequence that the model was trained on. Using the wrong template with an instruct model would lead to poor performance or unexpected behavior.

**Question: How can logprobs be misused by an attacker?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Logprobs leak information about the model's internal state beyond what sampled tokens alone reveal. The key threats include:
- **Adversarial prompt optimization** — logprobs provide a differentiable-like signal that attackers can use to iteratively refine jailbreak prompts. Instead of random guessing, they measure which token substitutions increase the probability of harmful completions, effectively using logprobs as a black-box gradient.
- **Model distillation/stealing** — logprobs expose the model's full probability distribution (or top-k), which provides far richer training signal than sampled tokens alone. An attacker can train a smaller "student" model on these soft labels, efficiently cloning the target model's behavior at a fraction of the original training cost.

Logprobs can also aid **system prompt extraction** and **model fingerprinting** (probability distributions can identify the model version or provider). This is why some providers restrict or disable logprobs access.

## 3️⃣ Instruction Hierarchies and Assistant Prefill (Optional)

AI labs are aware that input to an LLM is a flat string of tokens rather than something structured, and they are motivated to fix this to reduce jailbreaks, misuse, and the impact of indirect prompt injections. We already mentioned one layer: sanitization of control tokens at the API level.

Another layer is training models to respect [instruction hierarchies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13208) that define how models should behave when instructions of different priorities conflict — e.g., giving more weight to the system prompt than to user messages or third-party content from tool calls.

A related attack vector is "prefilling" tokens in the assistant turn, effectively putting words in the model's mouth. By injecting a compliant prefix like `"Sure, here is how to do it:"`, an attacker exploits the model's self-consistency to steer it past safety training. This technique is sometimes called [sockpuppeting](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/gb/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/sockpuppeting-how-a-single-line-can-bypass-llm-safety-guardrails). Some providers have stopped supporting prefill to prevent this effective jailbreaking technique (Anthropic dropped support for it starting with Claude Opus 4.6).

## Summary

Today you explored what happens under the hood of LLM inference APIs:

1. **Conversation Serialization** — Multi-turn conversations are serialized into flat token sequences using chat templates (ChatML, Mistral, etc.). The structured API is a convenience layer — the model sees one stream of tokens
2. **Token-level boundaries** — Special control tokens (`<|im_start|>`, `<|im_end|>`) mark message boundaries, but the serialization pipeline can be tricked into treating injected text as control tokens
3. **Logprobs** — The model produces a full probability distribution at each step; the API can expose this via logprobs, revealing information that sampled text alone doesn't

### Key Takeaways

- LLM "security boundaries" (system vs user prompt) are **conventions, not hard barriers** — the model sees a single token stream with no enforced separation
- **Control token injection** works at the tokenizer level (e.g., `apply_chat_template`) but production API stacks tokenize each part separately to prevent it
- **Logprobs** are the language or model output. They are a powerful signal that can be exploited for adversarial prompt optimization, model stealing, and system prompt extraction
